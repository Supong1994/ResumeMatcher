Modular Code Design:

Separated logic into three core modules: extractor.py, vectorizer.py, and matcher.py.

Dynamic Import Setup:

Used sys.path to dynamically resolve import paths so you can run everything from the notebooks/EDA.ipynb file without import errors.

Resume & JD Parsing:

Implemented in extractor.py. Reads .txt files from data/resumes/ and data/jobs/.

Vectorization (NLP):

Defined a model in vectorizer.py using TF-IDF or another NLP technique to convert text into numeric vectors.

Matching Logic:

matcher.py compares each resume against each JD using cosine similarity and returns a match score.

Notebook Execution:

EDA.ipynb demonstrates how all components work together to score resume-JD matches.
